# Default Homebrew MySQL server config

# Config Design
# 1. Disable bin log: binary log is only used in "Replication in slave machine". So we can disable this for now
# 2. Set innodb_log_file_size large enough. 
# 3. innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 0:  Fastest choice but less secure.
#              Any mysqld process crash can erase the last second of transactions.

# general design: since we know which transactions are succeed, even if the mysql crashes, we can recover the data easily.
# And the algorithm is deterministic, so we can re-collect already added certificates. So for the mysql config, we can sacrifice 
# the reliability. For better performance, we can even disable redo logs(not done yet).
