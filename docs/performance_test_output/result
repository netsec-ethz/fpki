There are 367 millions domains in total(does not change every year, even declines a little last year). Assume update frequency is 4 per year. Daily updates will be 8 millions(one RPC, one PC). It takes 4 hours to append and retrieve the daily updates. Even my lap top can do the job for all the domains -:)
